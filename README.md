## Repository for intro into using Redis as a cache

### Setting up Redis

Refer to the file named redis-cli-commands.txt for setting up and starting Redis
on your local machine (linux based). In case of Windows, you need to setup WSL
and use the extension for running WSL through Visual Studio Code.

### Starting the node.js server

Navigate to the backend-example folder and run:

1. run npm install (need to do this only on the first run to gather all the
   dependencies)
2. run npm run devStart
